## Boolean Satisfiability Problem
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem, or SAT, is a foundational problem in theoretical computer science and logic. It involves determining whether there exists a set of values for variables that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In simpler terms, SAT asks if it's possible to find a way to assign truth values (true or false) to variables so that an expression made up of ANDs, ORs, and NOTs becomes true.

SAT is known for being the first problem that was proven to be NP-complete. This classification means that all problems in the class NP, which are verifiable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine, are at least as difficult to solve as SAT. Hence, it is a central problem in computational complexity theory, influencing numerous fields from artificial intelligence to software verification.

## Introduction to the Hybrid Classical-Quantum Framework
Welcome to this repository, which introduces an innovative Hybrid Classical-Quantum Framework to tackle the SAT problem. This approach capitalizes on the strengths of both classical and quantum computing paradigms, addressing the limitations and leveraging the advantages of each.

#### Framework Overview
The methodology employed in this framework is a strategic division of the SAT problem into two components: quantum_sat and classical_sat. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Quantum SAT: We begin with the quantum_sat part, utilizing quantum computing to tackle this segment of the problem. Using the quantum counting algorithm, we approximate the number of potential solutions, setting the stage for a more targeted search. This is followed by employing Grover's algorithm to conduct a heuristic search within the quantum search space, efficiently pinpointing possible solutions.

Classical SAT: Subsequently, we transition to the classical_sat part, which comprises the remainder of the SAT problem. This phase involves a linear verification to determine if the solutions obtained from the quantum_sat phase also satisfy the classical_sat conditions. Only the solutions that meet both criteria are considered valid for the complete SAT problem.

#### Advantages of the Hybrid Approach
The hybrid framework is particularly advantageous for several reasons:

Efficiency: By harnessing Grover's algorithm, our framework achieves a square-root reduction in search complexity compared to traditional classical methods. This quantum advantage significantly accelerates the solution process.

Scalability: Dividing the SAT problem reduces the complexity of the quantum part, making it more manageable and solvable using current quantum hardware capabilities. This division results in a larger, more easily navigable solution space within the quantum realm.

Simplicity: After the quantum computations, the remaining classical check is straightforward, involving only a linear assessment of the pre-identified quantum solutions.

This hybrid methodology not only simplifies the solving process but also enhances the overall computational efficiency, making it a compelling approach for addressing large-scale SAT problems
